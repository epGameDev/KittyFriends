# ZTM Course Project

### Learning React:

Took the time to learn a little bit of React while working toward the MERN stack so that I may build some awesome apps.

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends

I decided to do some changes so that I have a more personal feel and attachment to the project and it was fun all around. Learned some great things and progress is coming great.

Thanks for reading!
