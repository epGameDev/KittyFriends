### Learning React:

Took the time to learn a little bit of React while working toward the MERN stack so that I may build some awesome apps. The purpose of the app is to pull from a public API and use the data in a react app to filter through a list of people or "friends". I chose to use cats because they are better than the robots. :) All in all it was a fun and simple project to get me started in React. 

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends
